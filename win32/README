Visual Studio 2017
------------------

To build the Zint library DLL and the command line tool "zint.exe" with PNG
support for x86/Win32:

Install git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
Install cmake (https://cmake.org/download/)

Open a "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017" (should be available under the
"Visual Studio 2017" tab in the Start menu).

Make sure git and cmake are in your PATH, e.g. (your paths may differ)

  set "PATH=C:\Program Files\Git\cmd;%PATH%"
  set "PATH=C:\Program Files\CMake\bin;%PATH%"

Download zint, zlib and libpng by going to the directory you want to clone them
into:

  set "PROJECT_DIR=<project-directory>"
  cd %PROJECT_DIR%

and cloning each:

  git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/zint/code zint
  git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/libpng/code lpng
  git clone https://github.com/madler/zlib.git zlib

First build zlib:

  cd zlib

  nmake -f win32\Makefile.msc LOC="-DASMV -DASMINF=" OBJA="inffas32.obj match686.obj"

  cd ..

and then lpng:

  cd lpng

  cmake -G"Visual Studio 15 2017"^
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release^
        -DPNG_BUILD_ZLIB=ON^
        -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIRS=..\zlib^
        -DPNG_STATIC=ON^
        -DPNG_SHARED=OFF^
        -H.^
        -Bbuild

  cmake --build build --config Release

  cd ..

If you now open "%PROJECT_DIR%\zint\win32\zint.sln" with Visual Studio 2017, you
should be able to build the Release configuration for Win32.

"zint.dll" and "zint.exe" will be in "zint\win32\Release".

To build Zint Studio ("qtZint.exe"), you need to have Qt installed, which
involves signing up for a Qt account and installing the Qt Maintenance Tool.
(https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)
Using this tool you can install various versions of Qt and various optional
components.

The following requires the "MSVC 2017 32-bit" component to be installed.

As of writing Qt 5.14.2 is the latest release that includes this component and
is used here. Add the location of this component to your PATH, e.g. (your path
may differ):

  set "PATH=C:\Qt\5.14.2\msvc2017\bin;%PATH%"

Then build Zint Studio "qtZint.exe":

  cd zint\frontend_qt

  qmake frontend_qt_zintdll.pro
  nmake clean
  nmake release

  cd ..\..

This creates "zint\frontend_qt\release\qtZint.exe". It requires the Zint DLL to
run, so add its location to your PATH:

  set "PATH=%PROJECT_DIR%\zint\win32\Release;%PATH%"

You should now be able to run Zint Studio:

  zint\frontend_qt\release\qtZint


Visual Studio 2015
------------------

The solution and project files for Visual Studio 2015 have been moved to the
sub-directory vs2015 and are no longer maintained. However by copying the steps
above and adapting the settings from the Visual Studio 2017 project files (and
adding any sources missing), they should be pretty serviceable.

For information on building a standalone version of Zint Studio using Visual
Studio 2015, see "frontend_qt/howto_build_qzint_using_msvs2015.txt"


Visual C++ 6
------------

See "win32\zint_cmdline_vc6\readme.txt"


MinGW/MSYS
----------

If not already installed, download and run the MinGW Installation Manager setup
(https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/downloads/68260/mingw-get-setup.exe/) and
using it install the packages:

  mingw-developer-toolkit-bin
  mingw32-base-bin
  mingw32-gcc-g++-bin
  msys-base-bin

(This should include mingw32-libz-dll)

Any reasonably modern version of Qt can be used. The following uses Qt 5.14.2.
Using the Qt Maintenance Tool (see the Visual Studio 2017 instructions above)
install the "MinGW 7.3.0 32-bit" component.

(Note the Qt MinGW version does not necessarily have to match the version of
MinGW installed, but the closer the better).

Open a MinGW/MSYS shell by clicking/running e.g. (your path may differ)

  C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat

As above make sure git and cmake are in your PATH.

Add the Qt MinGW 7.3.0 32-bit component to your PATH, e.g. (your path may
differ):

  export PATH="/c/Qt/5.14.2/mingw73_32/bin":${PATH}

Go into the directory you want to use and clone zint and libpng:

  PROJECT_DIR="<project-directory>"
  cd ${PROJECT_DIR}

  git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/zint/code zint
  git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/libpng/code lpng

To compile lpng on MSYS, a bit of fiddling is needed. Go to the directory:

  cd lpng

On Windows git usually converts UNIX line endings to DOS ones. Undo this:

  dos2unix * scripts/*

Attempt to do the usual GNU make:

  ./configure
  make

This will fail with a syntax error. To fix:

  sed -i 's/\r//' pnglibconf.h

And then do the make again:

  make
  make install

  cd ..

The lpng includes should be in "/usr/local/include". Tell gcc to search there by
setting C_INCLUDE_PATH:

  export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include

Now we should be able to build zint normally, except for telling cmake to
generate MSYS compatible makefiles:

  cd zint

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" ..
  make

  cd ../..

This creates:

zint/build/backend/libzint.dll
zint/build/frontend/zint.exe
zint/build/frontend_qt/zint-qt.exe

The Zint command line tool "zint.exe" and Zint Studio "zint-qt.exe" need
"libzint.dll" to run so add its location to your PATH:

  export PATH="${PROJECT_DIR}/zint/build/backend":${PATH}

You should now be able to run the command line tool:

  zint/build/frontend/zint

And Zint Studio:

  zint/build/frontend_qt/zint-qt
