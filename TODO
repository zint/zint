If you are interested in improving this package then here are a few ideas.

Backend
-------
 * Create filters for more output file formats.
 * The code was developed to be easy to understand rather than efficient so may
   benefit from some memory optimisation for embedded systems.
 * Support for Super Code and Data Strip desirable, and any other
   industry symbologies not currently included.

GUI Frontend
------------
 * Allow dragging and dropping to external apps.

Packaging
---------
Binary packages are needed for distribution in the following formats:
 * RPMs for various Linux distros (.spec file now available thanks to Radist).
 * Install binaries for Mac OSX.

Translations
------------
Documentation is currently only in English. If you have the knowledge and the
time please consider translating into other languages.
